This folder is made for ABCD I ratio analysys.
I=(Sa+Sb)/(Sa+Sb+Sc+Sd)

First we calculate the ele effi Tag-WptHLT, Probe-SuperCluster, PassingProbe - Sa+Sb area
Then we calculate the ele effi Tag-WptHLT, Probe-SuperCluster, PassingProbe - Sa+Sb+Sc+Sd area, which is Wpt cut without SigmaIetaIeta cut.

Then we divide them to get I ratio.
